# Snake.js

### A(n other...) micro-framework to make very simple applications in Javascript

Snake.js has been developed as a result of a personal challenge : creating a JS framework that can be used by chaining functions.
No performance revolution or competition with existing frameworks with it, just fun ;).

## Install and use Snake.js as the first time

You must have an HTML file to run your Snake.js application.

- Update your HTML file by creating a unique element in the DOM.

```html
<div id="snake-app"></div>
```

- [Download this file](public/assets/js/snake.js) and insert it in your project repository.

- Insert this tag at the end of the "body" tag of your HTML file :

```html
<div id="snake-app"></div>
...
<script href="(path)/snake.js"></script>
```

- Add a "script" tag with this code :

```html
<div id="snake-app"></div>
...
<script href="(path)/snake.js"></script>
<script>
  snake("#snake-app").render();
</script>
```

- And see the result in your navigator :
